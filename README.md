# realworld-pandas

## 🏆 Purpose
This repository is a collection of real-world data analysis and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) projects using **Pandas**.  
The goal is to build practical, interview-ready skills for Data Science and Business/Data Analytics internships by analyzing diverse datasets across multiple industries.  
Each project is designed to mirror the problems and workflows encountered in actual business environments.
